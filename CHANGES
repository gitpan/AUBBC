Improvement history for AUBBC

v4.06 - 04/12/2011

Fixed - The hash for tag_security() needed the images and link renamed to a tag
name being used. Changed the image name to img and the link to url. Read
"Tag Security Levels" for more info.

Fixed - security for links was in method make_link and was causing an access issue
if used outside of the module. Made a new method to check link access now the
make_link method could be used outside of the module without the security access
in it, as intended.

Changed - forgot to say in version 4.05 that I changed the aubbc_error so a new line
will be added after each inserted error.

v4.05 - 04/05/2011

Addition - Assign security levels for links, images, built and code tags.
New subroutine names: security_levels, user_level, tag_security, check_access

Changed - The default value for $AUBBC::BAD_MESSAGE is now 'Unathorized'

v4.04 - 02/05/2011

Fixed - Bug with quote tag, needed to convert all its tags.

v4.03 - 02/03/2011

Addition - New Object method aubbc_error . Developers can now controle if or when
to handle errors, see the POD 'Error Message' for usage.

Fixed - All built-in tags only convert balanced tags so no unbalanced HTML can
be produced

Fixed - Bug in code_highlight a highlight regex needed to be changed after
version 4.01 to support the Parser style.

Improvement - Small restructure of add_build_tag and change the 'all' setting
of 'pattern' to allow more.

v4.02 - 11/28/2010

Fixed - The element ID for the code download started at 1 for every instance this
will force the browser to take priority to load the first ID it reads. The fix
starts the counter at 'time.$$.000' to try to produce a more unique ID for each
instance.

Fixed - under the code tag in do_ubbc line " $do_f[8] = '' if $do_f[8]; "
should have been $do_f[9] = '' if $do_f[9];

v4.01 - 11/08/2010

Fixed - Bug that converts the true text typed to the HTML code name.
All parts of the module where effected by this bug, in the code tag if the
author ment & #59 ; it would show ; . This also caused a long standing bug with
typing any HTML code name and saving it to a backend.
this fix removes the HTML code name regex in do_unicode and had to add/move two
filters in "script_escape to conver the & to an amp and ; to #59;" and
"html_to_text to conver amp to & and #59 to ;". This fix also helped in allowing
the regex's for highlighting subroutines to be made.

Fixed - had to add a null byte marker to escape_aubbc so the code tag's
highlighter can detect the escaped character and change it back. In do_all_ubbc
All markers get removed before the message is returned because FireFox can see
the null bytes as an error.

Addition - Perl subroutine highlighting for the code tag highlighter. Had a
problem making this till this version because a HTML code name can look like
&TheName; and a Perl subroutine looked the same till ; got converted.

Addition - AUBBC::make_image($align,$src,$width,$height,$alt) this is useful enough
to mention once.

v4.00 - 11/02/2010

Addition - New feature to the code tags aubbc_setting code_download.
the default setting for code_download is '^Download above code^' this message will
be the links name. the link will open a JavaScript pop-up window and write the
code in it to be copied or printed to a printer. A new JavaScript function was
added to the js_print method called MyCodePrint. JavaScript makes this feature
portable and dynamic. the link for code_download is added after the code_extra
setting so a disclaimer can be added before the code_download link

Addition - $AUBBC::MEMOIZE This setting can turn AUBBC's usage of Memoize on or off.
Default setting 1 will check if it needs to load Memoize, if loaded then load the sub's that need the speed.
Setting 0 will not use Memoize.

Addition - AUBBC::make_link($link,$name,$javascript,$target) this is useful enough
to mention once.

Improvement - After lots of testing I have removed all /o in the regex. One main
reason is Memoize provides enough speed.

v3.13 - 09/30/2010

Addition - do_ubbc New built-in tag [list][*=1]... [*]... [/list], This will
follow XHTML or HTML Transitional element style and XHTML or HTML Strict will not
support the elements that tag [*=1] in the [list] will produce
(use the other enumerated List Block tags for XHTML or HTML Strict).

Addition - do_ubbc New built-in tag [em]Hello[/em]

Addition - New value for setting line_break 2 for old <br style. This effects script_escape.

Addition - This module now uses Memoize for a massive speed improvement.
If you thought it was fast before, I hope your sitting down when you bench this version. LOL

Addition - added setting highlight_function to replace the highlighting method
of AUBBC with a costume one.

Fixed - in do_ubbc the line breaks was invalidating HTML for List Block elements

Improvement - in do_all_ubbc changed defining $msg each time. there could have
been a bug in past versions if an undefined variable was used after a defined message was
converted. was going to allow do_all_ubbc to pass the last message but decided
other people may see that as a bug.

Improvement - in do_all_ubbc moved if $do_flag[4] for no_bypass to a better spot

Improvement - in do_all_ubbc moved if for for_links to a better spot

Improvement - changed tags left,right and center to only convert balanced tags

v3.00 - 09/14/2010

Improvement - made it balls to the wall faster.

v2.21 - 09/09/2010 16:32:34

Fixed -  -withoutworldwriteables, bug with making an archive on windows to PAUSE.

v2.20 - 09/08/2010 19:40:55

Addition - in examples folder there is a bench.pl to test the speed and support
of all the Perl BBcode modules. BBCode::Parser Parse::BBCode HTML::BBCode HTML::BBReverse

Fixed - fixed a line break and new line sandbox bug

Improvement - Massive speed improvement to the hole module and no features lost.
changed new for faster loading, the module uses vars for some variables,
re-spaced the hole code.

v2.10 - 08/31/2010 11:17:13

Addition - adding type 4 to add_build_tag this will use style 3 but will work
different then the other built functions. Type 4 will print the text defined in
function and not point to a defined Perl subroutine.

Addition - added line_break setting to have control over the script_escape and
html_to_text methods converting html line break <br> and new line \n

Addition - added fix_amp this setting finds all the & that need to covert to the amp; html code name
so the w3c xhtml validation checks ok.

Addition - added no_img this setting will allow some control for using [img] tags
for security reasons

Fixed - bug in settings_prep when a setting gets changed html_type could change

Fixed - Better support for XHTML 1.0 Strict for some tags having issues in do_ubbc

Fixed - in do_ubbc the [url] tag produces a bug if a link is used as a name
the fix converts the period and/or colon of the name so its not seen as a new
link.

Improvement - in do_unicode removed then changed the two regexs to do a 3 in 1 filter.

Improvement - in html_to_text added a code to fix a <br> bug if ppl use html or xhtml line break.

Improvement - moved the pattern building code from do_build_tag to add_build_tag
so it only runs one time

Improvement - in add_build_tag using a hash array to store the build tag data so
there is no need to use split in do_build_tag

Improvement - in do_all_ubbc moved script_escape to a location where one call
to the function is needed

Improvement - in do_all_ubbc added check for undefined "$message" variable

Improvement - in script_escape added check for undefined "$text" variable

Improvement - in html_to_text added check for undefined "$html" variable

Improvement - in escape_aubbc converting the brackets one time with the html
code name so the filter will only need to run one time in do_all_ubbc. This
also fixes one bug in escape_aubbc

Removed - In script_escape removed the \cM regex, it is very rare that anyone will need
it so it wont be missed.


v2.0 - 10/07/2008 13:52:11

Fixed single tag [name] for build tags

Changed the regex in plain URL's

Removed bad patter setting and now using a more standard way to detect bad image tags

Fixed dynamic view in XHTML for the protect email method.

Added js_print method which will print out the javascript needed for the new protect email method

Added values for the code highlighter so it can support CSS classes

Added highlighting of variables and changed 2 quote regex to allow multi line quotes

and a few other things that make this 2.0

v1.30 - 09/08/2008 14:12:10

Fixed the function check in add_build_tag(), when the 1.20 changes where made this check was neglected

Edited add_build_tag() Error messages, hopefully they make more sense.

Now add_build_tag() name allows - and _ in it.

v1.20 - 09/07/2008 09:23:09

Fixed bug that bypassed utf tag converter if square bracket wasn't detected

Fixed Makefile.PL

v1.10 - 09/02/2008 09:49:46

Added two more tags [big]..[/big] and [small]..[/small].

Removed utf tag style [ux23] and [u://0931] to make more tag names available.

Changed add_build_tag() to use hash variable, see "Build your own tags" for the new style.

Changed the way functions should work for built tags, the custom function for built tags will receive the tag name and data of the tag. This is so one function can handle many tags.

Removed other site tags and setting other_sites_pattern, an example of them are in "Build your own tags"

Removed [time] tag, example in "Build your own tags".

Email now allows names with & sign

Now every message that is passed to do_all_ubbc() gets escaped before being returned if script_escape is Enabled.

All tags in %AUBBC_TAGS will only convert if lowercase.

"new" now uses the most standard referenced object method.

Removed DOS_prevent() method, since the script has been tested more and was causing a timing problem.

Removed [cd]#code[/cd] code tag, which had no code_class or code_extra.

Commented bad_pattern check for [email] tags, this security check is not needed because the next line will take care of all email tag security.

Added missing $AUBBC{image_border}, $AUBBC{html_type} and $AUBBC{image_wrap} to the none icon image.

Changed names of left and right align images to [left_img]..[/img] and [right_img]..[/img], also updated examples to show tags.

Added missing $AUBBC{html_type} to quote, code tags and code_highlight function.

v1.0 01/20/2008 08:46:08

Released.
