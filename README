=head1 Description

Advanced Universal Bulletin Board Code Tags used to create formatting effects in HTML or XHTML.

=head1 Abstract

The advantage of using this Bulletin Board Code tags is to restrict the usage of HTML/XHTML elements and
to make formating of posts easy to people that have no HTML/XHTML skill. Most sites that use these tags show a list of them and/or easy way to insert the tags to the form field by the user.

This module addresses many security issues the UBBC tags may have mainly cross site script also known as XSS.
Each message is escaped before it gets returned if script_escape is Enabled and checked for many types of security problems before that tag converts to HTML/XHTML.
The script_escape setting and method also converts the ' sign so the text can be stored in a SQL back-end.
Most of the free web portals use the | sign as the delimiter for the flat file database, the script_escape setting and method also converts that sign so the structure of the database is retained.

Allows easy conversion to HTML and XHTML, existing tags will convert to the HTML type set.

If there isn't a popular tag available this module provides a method to "Build your own tags" custom tags can help link to parts of the current web page, other web pages and add other HTML elements.

=head2 html_type

Default is 'html' and the only other support is 'xhtml'

=head2 code_class

 Default is '' and this allows a custom class, style and/or javascript to be used in any of the [code] [c] tags.

 must have a space before the text.

 example:

 code_class => ' class="quote"',

=head2 script_escape

This will turn on or off the sanitizer/escape security for the hole message.

Default is 1 on and 0 for Disable.

Notes: 1)The code highlighter works best with an escaped character format like the
script_escape => 1 setting can provide.

2) If this setting is disabled and a character escaping method or security filter is not used
can result is a security compromise of the AUBBC tags.

3) if Disabled the method "$message = $aubbc->script_escape($message);" can be used on the message as needed before do_all_ubbc() is called.


=head2 protect_email

  Default is 1 and other possible values are (0, 2, 3, 4).

  Can add a protection to hide emails in the [email] tag from email harvesters.


  Not 100% fool proof.

        0 - has no type of protection.


        1 - uses unicode type protection.


        2 - Javascript and unicode type protection.


        3 - Javascript and unicode type protection.


        4 - Javascript encryption

=head2 email_message

When the protect_email setting is 2, 3 or 4 it will display this message as the link.

Default message is '&#67;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#32;&#69;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;' and that say's 'Contact Email'

=head2 highlight_class#

This is for using your own class or font color for the code highlighter.

        highlight_class1 => ' class="highlightclass1"',

highlight_class1 = String quote

highlight_class2 = Comment's

highlight_class3 = String quote

=head1 Smilies Settings

These are the settings for using custom smilies.

Note: There are no Built-in smilies.

=head2 $aubbc->smiley_hash();

This is one of the two ways to import your custom smilies hash.

example:

  use AUBBC;
  my $aubbc = new AUBBC;
  my %smiley = (lol => 'lol.gif');
  $aubbc->smiley_hash(%smiley);

The way you use this smiley is [lol]

Must have the images_url set to the proper location.

images_url/smilies/lol.gif

=head2 %AUBBC::SMILEYS

This is one of the two ways to import your custom smiley hash.

example:

  my %smiley = (lol => 'lol.gif');

  %AUBBC::SMILEYS = %smiley;
  my $aubbc = new AUBBC;

The way you use this smiley is [lol]

Must have the images_url set to the proper location.

images_url/smileis/lol.gif

=head1 Build your own tags

These are the settings and methods for using custom tags.

=head2 $aubbc->add_build_tag(name=>'stuff', pattern=>'stuff' , type=>'stuff', function=>'stuff');

name - will be the tags name

pattern - limited to 'all' or 'l,n,-,:,_,s'

    'all' = 'a-z\d\:\-\s\_\/\.\;\&\=\?\-\+\#\%\~\,\|'
    'l' = 'a-z'
    'n' = '0-9'
    's' = ' '
    '-' = '-'
    ':' = ':'
    '_' = '_'

type - 1 is style [name://pattern], 2 is style [name]pattern[/name] and 3 is style [name]

function - a pre-defined subroutine that receives the matched pattern, tag name and returns what you want,

   Note: if the function returns undefined, '' or 0 the tag will not be changed.

Usage:

  package My_Message;

  use AUBBC;
  my $aubbc = new AUBBC;

  $aubbc->add_build_tag(
        name     => 'ok',
        pattern  => 'l,s',
        type     => 1,
        function => 'My_Message::check_ok_tag',
        );
  $aubbc->add_build_tag(
        name     => 'ip',
        pattern  => '',
        type     => 3,
        function => 'My_Message::get_some_tag',
        );
  $aubbc->add_build_tag(
        name     => 'agent',
        pattern  => '',
        type     => 3,
        function => 'My_Message::get_some_tag',
        );

  my $message = '[ok://test me] [ok://test other] [ok://n0 w00rk] [ip] [agent]';

  $message = $aubbc->do_all_ubbc($message);

  print $message;

  sub check_ok_tag {
  my ($tag_name, $text_from_AUBBC) = @_;

   if ($text_from_AUBBC eq 'test me') {
        return 'Works Good 1';
        }
         else {
               return 'Works Good 2';
               }
  }

  sub get_some_tag {
  my ($tag_name, $text_from_AUBBC) = @_;
  $tag_name = lc($tag_name);
  $text_from_AUBBC = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} if ($tag_name eq 'ip');
  $text_from_AUBBC = $ENV{'HTTP_USER_AGENT'} if ($tag_name eq 'agent');
  return $text_from_AUBBC;
  }

  1;

=head2 $aubbc->remove_build_tag($name, $option);

There are two ways to use this.

1) Remove a single built tag: $aubbc->remove_build_tag($name);

2) Remove all built tags: $aubbc->remove_build_tag('', 1);

=head1 Error Message

=head2 $AUBBC::BAD_MESSAGE

Default message is 'Error', this message is used when the code finds bad characters in [email] or [img] tags.

 Usage of this setting:

  use AUBBC;
  $AUBBC::BAD_MESSAGE = 'Unauthorized use of characters or pattern in this tag.';
  # est...

=head1 Debug

The Debug setting will send a lot of messages to warn and is not recommended to leave on all the time.

=head2 $AUBBC::DEBUG_AUBBC

 Default is '' off, and Enabled is 1.

 Usage of this setting:

  use AUBBC;
  $AUBBC::DEBUG_AUBBC = 1;
  # est...

=head1 Version

Returns the current version of the module.

=head2 $aubbc->version();

=head1 History

v2.0 - 10/07/2008 13:52:11

Fixed single tag [name] for build tags

Changed the regex in plain URL's

Removed bad patter setting and now using a more standard way to detect bad image tags

Fixed dynamic view in XHTML for the protect email method.

Added js_print method which will print out the javascript needed for the new protect email method

Added values for the code highlighter so it can support CSS classes

Added highlighting of variables and changed 2 quote regex to allow multi line quotes

and a few other things that make this 2.0

v1.30 - 09/08/2008 14:12:10

Fixed the function check in add_build_tag(), when the 1.20 changes where made this check was neglected

Edited add_build_tag() Error messages, hopefully they make more sence.

Now add_build_tag() name allows - and _ in it.

v1.20 - 09/07/2008 09:23:09

Fixed bug that bypassed utf tag converter if square bracket wasn't detected

Fixed Makefile.PL

v1.10 - 09/02/2008 09:49:46

Added two more tags [big]..[/big] and [small]..[/small].

Removed utf tag style [ux23] and [u://0931] to make more tag names available.

Changed add_build_tag() to use hash variable, see "Build your own tags" for the new style.

Changed the way functions should work for built tags, the custom function for built tags will receive the tag name and data of the tag. This is so one function can handle many tags.

Removed other site tags and setting other_sites_pattern, an example of them are in "Build your own tags"

Removed [time] tag, example in "Build your own tags".

Email now allows names with & sign

Now every message that is passed to do_all_ubbc() gets escaped before being returned if script_escape is Enabled.

All tags in %AUBBC_TAGS will only convert if lowercase.

"new" now uses the most standard referenced object method.

Removed DOS_prevent() method, since the script has been tested more and was causing a timing problem.

Removed [cd]#code[/cd] code tag, which had no code_class or code_extra.

Commented bad_pattern check for [email] tags, this security check is not needed because the next line will take care of all email tag security.

Added missing $AUBBC{image_border}, $AUBBC{html_type} and $AUBBC{image_wrap} to the none icon image.

Changed names of left and right align images to [left_img]..[/img] and [right_img]..[/img], also updated examples to show tags.

Added missing $AUBBC{html_type} to quote, code tags and code_highlight function.

v1.0 01/20/2008 08:46:08

Released.

=head1 COPYLEFT

 AUBBC.pm, v2.0 10/07/2008 13:52:11 By: N.K.A

 Advanced Universal Bulletin Board Code Tags.

 Note: This code has a lot of settings and works good
 with most default settings.
